Pi_value = 3.14 #var should be uppercase to represent constant so it shoild be PI_VALUE. pi will always be 3.14.
userAge = 25 # should be snake case so user_age
user_location = "New York"   # i dont understand why this ones wrong  if im being honest, unless maybe if you consider the location a constant
MAXLIMIT = 1000 #well it  should use snake case, and maxlimit can also change, so we should take away the caps and change it to max_limit
